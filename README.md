# anagrams x scrabble

Created by Corinna Chen

## Inspiration
I was inspired by playing Anagrams on GamePigeon! I noticed I was restricted to the amount of time I was given and the amount of letters I recieved. I preformed poorly when I was given harder letters to work with such as z or x because points were based on the amount of letters in the word. I wanted to customize the game to my liking, which is why I decided to recreate the game with some changes. 

## functionality 
This game functions as a single player version of Anagrams with the scoring system of Scrabble.
